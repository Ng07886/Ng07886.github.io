    <p>I have a lot of experience with computers being a Computer Science major. I have experienced multiple problems with my personal computer from computing issues connectivity issues, and software issues. One thing I have learned with my experiences is that if you search hard enough you will always find a solution to the problem. Specific examples I have had troubleshooting computers would be when my personal computer has frozen, shut down unexpectedly, overheated, has had Internet connection issues and had slow performance issues. I also have experience with projectors, because I have given multiple presentations in Tate and the Miller learning Center involving them. I believe my background in computers will make me a great addition to the Office of Information Technology Team.</p>
