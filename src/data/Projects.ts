    Description:
      "My team and I were recognized for outstanding achievement in NCR Voyix’s annual hackathon, securing a place in the top 10 out of hundreds of entries. I contributed to the front-end development of a web application for drive-thru operations, enhancing user experience with license plate-based order retrieval. I designed and implemented the frontend components using TypeScript, React.js, HTML, and CSS within NCR’s restaurant online ordering platform. I also collaborated with the team to integrate the front end with the backend license plate detection system, which utilized YOLOv5 Object Detection, Tesseract Optical Character Recognition, and Open Computer Vision.",
